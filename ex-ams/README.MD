# Ex-AMS

## What is that?

Ex-AMS (from “exams” and AMS aka Alma Mater Studiorum) is a desktop application for students. It comes with the possibility to manage a list of exams with calculations of degree’s final vote, based on average and weighed average. It also has a Calendar for manage exams dates.
Calculations of some values are based on Alma Mater Studiorum (University of Bologna) specifics.

## Why?

Because at the time it still made sense to use desktop applications to do things. Nowadays everybody uses smartphones, and you will find a lot of apps that do the same things of Ex-AMS. But at the time, a high number of students of my university did use my application; it was easy to use, and it did very well things. 

Two principal aspects made it so good: the built-in Calendar, and the possibility to add and remove exams (with CFU and vote) and see immediately HOW the degree vote changes. This made exams previsions and scheduling more motivating and – as much as possible – accurate.

## Technical Details

It’s a simple application written during my studies. I written it in C# using WPF technology. It runs on Windows 7 and later.
