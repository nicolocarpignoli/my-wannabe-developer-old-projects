# my-wannabe-developer-old-projects
A collection of old-wannabe-developer projects of mine. Don't look back in anger.
Not every project is open-source. Sorry about that.

Work in Progress

* MOOVBIT (Prototype of a complete IoT platform for sports monitoring)
* SVPlatform (Spike for a secure remote voting application)
* A Fury Of Snow (2D-old-Final-Fantasy style RPG placed on Game of Thrones world)
* Ex-AMS (Exams register, graduation vote calculator app with integrated calendar).
